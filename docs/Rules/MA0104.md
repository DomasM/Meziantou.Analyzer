# MA0104 - Do not create a type with a name from the BCL

````c#
public class String // MA0104
{
}
````

You can configure the types / namespaces to consider in the `.editorconfig` file

````
MA0104.namespaces_regex = ^System($|\.)
MA0104.use_preview_types = true # use types from preview versions of .NET
````

By default the rule only applies to public types. Add the following line to the `.editorconfig` file to consider all types:

````
MA0104.only_consider_public_symbols = false
````
